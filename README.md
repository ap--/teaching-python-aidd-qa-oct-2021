# Python Questions and Answers

Hello everyone :wave:

This is the project repo for the "Python - Questions and Answers" session of the
AIDD Project's ([Advanced Machine Learning for Innovative Drug Discovery](https:/ai-dd.eu))
Summer School in Oct 2021. We'll use this repo as a central point of discussion,
example code sharing, debugging and other Python Q&A related things.

- :question: &nbsp; If you have any Python programming related questions [open a new issue](https://github.com/ap--/teaching-python-aidd-qa-oct-2021/issues)
and ask away!
- :star:  &nbsp; If you want to add a code example, either add it to the issue or fork the repository and create a new pull request.
- :speech_balloon: &nbsp; If you're not sure where to ask, just start a [new Discussion](https://github.com/ap--/teaching-python-aidd-qa-oct-2021/discussions)


### "I have the exact same Question!?!"

To upvote questions that are important to you let's use the `:+1:` :+1: &nbsp; emoji.
Or comment on the issue, that works too :smile:

### live session

The live session will happen on Tuesday 2021-10-26 11:00h.

I'll keep answering questions throughout the week, and we'll go through the
most upvoted or most interesting questions in that session. Also feel free to
ask new questions during that session.
